**BTG-controlled TypeScript conformance baseline for ENTITY v3.3.**

> This repository is maintained and controlled by Blackmore Technology Group. It is cross-language reproducibility evidence. It is **not** an unrelated third-party implementation and must not be cited as independent external validation.

[ENTITY](https://github.com/blackmore-technology-group/ENTITY) | [v3.3.0 release](https://github.com/blackmore-technology-group/ENTITY/releases/tag/v3.3.0) | [Engineering evidence](https://github.com/blackmore-technology-group/ENTITY/blob/main/docs/ENGINEERING_EVIDENCE.md) | [Independent interoperability challenge](https://github.com/blackmore-technology-group/ENTITY/blob/main/docs/INTEROPERABILITY_CHALLENGE.md)

## What this repository verifies

This implementation exercises the published ENTITY conformance campaigns in TypeScript, including the v3.2 adoption campaign and the v3.3 Verifiable Reality campaign. CI verifies the sealed kit checksum before executing the language-native classifier.

For v3.3 the required public result is:

- release: 3.3.0
- protected ENTITY release commit: 9c79f987207592cb6791e1a8956f23351cdfb2d3
- vectors: **20/20** (10 valid / 10 invalid)
- sealed-kit SHA-256: 8b39ee01fb7346f33a57530e925b545d2bf9a770c7ec60724e28a4971d55a46
- deterministic result SHA-256: 82bd1f1fb328edd37a26d8ea60ede5a599c7d9af5027bffd73b9e52843b5a51d

## Run the v3.3 campaign

`	ext
npm ci
npm run build
node dist/reality_v33.js
`

The primary v3.3 implementation is $(System.Collections.Hashtable.layout).

## Other controlled campaigns

`	ext
node dist/test.js`nnode dist/adoption_v32.js
`

See .github/workflows/cleanroom-verify.yml for the complete CI procedure, exact toolchain setup, checksum verification, evidence capture and artifact retention.

## Verification boundary

A passing result shows that this BTG-controlled TypeScript implementation classifies the sealed public vectors consistently with the published campaign. It does **not** establish that a real-world claim is objectively true, and it does **not** establish independent external interoperability merely because another BTG-controlled language converges on the same result.

The stronger external question remains open:

> Can an unrelated engineer or organization reproduce the same semantics from public specification/test material without using BTG implementation code?

A deliberately narrow starting point is [ENTITY issue #27](https://github.com/blackmore-technology-group/ENTITY/issues/27).

## Contributing

Reproducible build failures, portability fixes, language-idiomatic improvements, test corrections and specification ambiguities are welcome. If your goal is to produce **independent** conformance evidence, use a repository controlled outside BTG and follow the independence rules in the [interoperability challenge](https://github.com/blackmore-technology-group/ENTITY/blob/main/docs/INTEROPERABILITY_CHALLENGE.md).
