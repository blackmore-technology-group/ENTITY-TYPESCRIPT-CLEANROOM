**BTG-controlled TypeScript conformance baseline for ENTITY v3.4.2.**

> This repository is maintained and controlled by Blackmore Technology Group. It is cross-language reproducibility evidence. It is **not** an unrelated third-party implementation and must not be cited as independent external validation.

[ENTITY](https://github.com/blackmore-technology-group/ENTITY) · [v3.4.2 release](https://github.com/blackmore-technology-group/ENTITY/releases/tag/v3.4.2) · [Documentation portal](https://blackmore-technology-group.github.io/ENTITY-DOCS/) · [External verification challenge](https://github.com/blackmore-technology-group/ENTITY/issues/55)

## What this repository verifies

This TypeScript implementation exercises published ENTITY conformance campaigns, including the frozen/earlier clean-room baseline, v3.2 adoption, v3.3 Verifiable Reality and the **v3.4.2 Global Passport campaign**.

CI verifies sealed-kit checksums before executing the language-native classifiers and retains verification evidence as workflow artifacts.

## ENTITY v3.4.2 Global Passport campaign

The current TypeScript campaign is checked by repository CI as:

- sealed vectors: **26/26 PASS**;
- canonical campaign result SHA-256: `45af773554a7191c1b49a75c636a1106afb1de36d788bb00d7af56097b8d1b0e`;
- `overall_valid: true`.

The v3.4.2-specific sealed kit used by the language baselines is committed with SHA-256:

`ced70113f1d153627eb972b11adbf20e502ed086e0b13e8abf1dc5adc4c2e716`

Run the current TypeScript campaign:

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
node dist/passport_v34.js
```

The repository also retains historical sealed material from earlier ENTITY campaigns for provenance and reproducibility. Those historical artifacts are not the current v3.4.2 TypeScript campaign target.

## Other controlled campaigns

```bash
node dist/test.js
node dist/adoption_v32.js
node dist/reality_v33.js
```

See [`.github/workflows/cleanroom-verify.yml`](.github/workflows/cleanroom-verify.yml) for the CI procedure, toolchain setup, checksum verification, evidence capture and artifact retention.

## Where this fits in ENTITY

ENTITY v3.4.2 adds the Blackmore Technology Data Universe (BTDU) while preserving the Global Passport/profile architecture and the core primitives:

`ENTITY → AUTHORITY → RIGHT → EVENT → VALUE`

The architecture preserves identity, authority, rights, evidence, provenance and portable economic state without treating infrastructure possession as sovereign authority.

If you are evaluating ENTITY rather than this TypeScript baseline specifically, start at the [ENTITY repository](https://github.com/blackmore-technology-group/ENTITY), the [documentation portal](https://blackmore-technology-group.github.io/ENTITY-DOCS/), or the [external verification challenge](https://github.com/blackmore-technology-group/ENTITY/issues/55).

## Verification boundary

A passing result shows that this **BTG-controlled TypeScript implementation** classifies its sealed campaign consistently with the published v3.4.2 target.

It does **not** establish unrelated third-party validation, objective external truth, regulatory compliance, legal title, accounting fair value or independent live interoperability merely because another BTG-controlled language converges on the same result.

The stronger external question remains open:

> Can an unrelated engineer or organization reproduce ENTITY semantics from public specifications and sealed test material without using BTG implementation code?

## Contributing

Useful contributions include reproducible build failures, portability fixes, language-idiomatic improvements, test corrections, specification ambiguities and independently authored counterexamples.

If your goal is to produce **independent** conformance evidence, use a repository controlled outside BTG and follow the public verification challenge's independence rules.
